# Chatbot-in-Python-with-IA
I am Martin Salvatore, son of a medical clinician who works in a public hospital in Mendoza, Argentina called Lagomaggiore. The objective of this project is to create a chatbot that can answer common questions about the patient, so that doctors can be more efficient and save time.

## What is the project about?
The idea is to create a chatbot that uses IA, that could be connected at least to Whatsapp

## Requirements Capture 
First I did a requirements capture to my dad, so that I know what the magnitude of the project is. And what I would need to know to start the project.

## Documentation of the project
On intents.json file, you can see the list of intents that the chatbot can understand. So that it can identify the intent of the user and respond accordingly, generating a logical response for every situation. 


## intents.json
The explanation of the intents.json file is as follows:

"tag": used to quickly what is the intention of the user
"patterns": patterns that users will repeat to the chatbot
"responses": responses that the chatbot will give to the user
